# Unbiased News Website via MERN stack

As part of the Digital Shaper Program of [TechLabs](https://techlabs.org/), we learnt a lot about Web Development, built our own news website via the MERN sack and deployed it using Heroku. I was the Head of Operations in the team, so I was responsible for coordinating the technical side of the project. Regarding actual coding I mostly worked on the backend, i.e. setting up MongoDB, connecting it via Mongoose to Express and communicating with the front-end team to ensure that we have common APIs and seamless integration between the two parts. You can read more about the project [here](https://techlabsdus.medium.com/athena-delta-news-search-engine-1c93b40fda6c) and have a look at the [code](https://github.com/kierandidi/news_search_engine) as well as the [website](https://athena-delta.herokuapp.com/).
