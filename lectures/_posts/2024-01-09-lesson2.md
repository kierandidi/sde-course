# Lesson 2 - SDEs and how to condition them

### Optional reading for this lesson
- 

### [Slides](/assets/slides/r255-l2.pdf)

#### Video (soon)

In this lecture we continue with our discussion of SDEs and how to manipulate them. Specifically, we will look how we can reverse SDEs via Nelsons Duality Formula and how we can condition SDEs via Doob's h-transform.
