### 1. Girsanov Theorem

This lecture, we will talk about the Girsanov Theorem, one of the most important results in stochastic calculus. It allows us to change the measure of a stochastic process, which is very useful in many applications. 

To talk about the Girsanov theorem, we need to fulfill a few conditions, among them *Novikov's condition*.
ß
> Definition: A stochastic process $$\Theta(t)$$ satifies Novikov's condition if

$$ \mathbb{E} \left[ \exp \left( \frac{1}{2} \int_0^T \Theta(t)^2 dt \right) \right] < \infty $$ß
