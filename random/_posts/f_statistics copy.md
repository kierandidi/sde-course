# Stats

# Z Test: Distribution normal, Population variance known

Z becomes large (more “extreme”)

if the gap between the sample mean and the null mean is large or

if the sample size is very large.


From CLT it follows that the Z statistic is defined as:

$$
Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}
$$

where $$\bar{x}$$ is the sample mean, $$\mu_0$$ is the null mean, $$\sigma$$ is the population standard deviation, and $$n$$ is the sample size.

A test to determine if a sample could have plausibly arisen from a given normal distribution is called a 
�
Z-test

chi-square test

Generally speaking, a goodness-of-fit test is used to test if sample data fits a distribution from a certain population.
While the exact form depends on the problem, it's usually a great approximation to calculate

where

A statistic of this form is called a Pearson's
