# Running R in VS Code

The classic way to run R is in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), but since I wanted to minimize the time I need for switching between several tools I wanted to set up R in VSCode. There are some great guides out there how to do, for example which [extensions to use](https://renkun.me/2022/03/06/my-recommendations-of-vs-code-extensions-for-r/) or [how to set it up step-by-step](https://schiff.co.nz/blog/r-and-vscode/). 

Here I only list the packages I currently use for R (also mentioned in the [post on my Mac setup](https://main--kdidi.netlify.app/blog/tools/2022-09-17-mac-setup/)):

- R language extension: syntax highlighting etc
- R Debugger: allows debugging for R programs

The R Debugger is actually very handy since it allows you to interactively inspect your data frames in VS Code. Just type `View(df_test)` to view your data frame called `df_test` and it will show you a scrollable table view of your data frame in the pane where it also displays your plots (see the screenshot below).

</p>

In addition to the VS Code extensions, once you have R installed I recommend installing the following R packages via `install.packages(<package name>)`:

- languageserver: to allow communication between the R shell and VS Code
- radian: huge improvement over the standard R shell
- tidyverse: everything you will need for data processing

When you now want to run an R file, you first have to launch an R terminal. And here is the tricky bit: **Don't** type R in the VS Code terminal, but rather open a new terminal by clicking the small arrow next to the plus button in the terminal and click R terminal; only via this way will VS Code be able to communicate with the R session.

If you want to enable the keyboard shortcuts you know and love from RStudio, you can add the following input to the `keybindings.json` configuration file (from [this webpage](https://github.com/REditorSupport/vscode-R/wiki/Keyboard-shortcuts)):

~~~js
// file: "keybindings.json"
[
  {
    "key": "alt+-",
    "command": "type",
    "when": "editorLangId == r && editorTextFocus || editorLangId == rmd && editorTextFocus",
    // if you want using quarto, try this
    // "when": "editorLangId =~ /r|rmd|qmd/ && editorTextFocus",
    "args": {"text": " <- "}
  },
  {
    "key": "ctrl+shift+m",
    "command": "type",
    "when": "editorLangId == r && editorTextFocus || editorLangId == rmd && editorTextFocus",
    "args": {"text": " %>% "}
  },
  {
    "key": "ctrl+shift+m",
    "command": "-workbench.actions.view.problems"
  },

  // input indicative of r markdown code chunk
  {
    "key": "ctrl+shift+i",
    "command": "editor.action.insertSnippet",
    "when": "editorTextFocus && editorLangId == 'rmd'",
    "args": {
        "snippet": "```{r}\n${TM_SELECTED_TEXT}$0\n```"
    },
    "label": "input indicative of r markdown code chunk"
  },

  // you can also input indicative of code chunk in `r` file by inserting "# %% ":
  // specifics in `https://github.com/REditorSupport/vscode-R/pull/662`
  {
    "key": "ctrl+shift+i",
    "command": "editor.action.insertSnippet",
    "when": "editorTextFocus && editorLangId == 'r'",
    "args": {
        "snippet": "$LINE_COMMENT %% "
    },
    "label": "input indicative of code chunk"
  },

  // open help panel for selection
  {
    "key": "f1",
    "command": "r.helpPanel.openForSelection",
    "when": "editorTextFocus && editorLangId == 'r' || editorTextFocus && editorLangId == 'rmd'"
  },

  // RStudio keybinding for R Package development
  {
    "key": "ctrl+shift+b",
    "command": "r.install",
    "when": "resourceLangId == 'r'"
  },
  {
    "key": "ctrl+shift+e",
    "command": "r.check",
    "when": "resourceLangId == 'r'"
  },
  {
    "key": "ctrl+shift+t",
    "command": "r.test",
    "when": "resourceLangId == 'r'"
  },
  {
    "key": "ctrl+shift+d",
    "command": "r.document",
    "when": "resourceLangId == 'r'"
  },
  {
    "key": "ctrl+shift+l",
    "command": "r.loadAll",
    "when": "resourceLangId == 'r'"
  },
  {
    "key": "ctrl+alt+p",
    "command": "r.runCommand",
    "when": "editorTextFocus && editorLangId == 'r'",
    "args": ".vsc.browser(httpgd::hgd_url(), viewer = \"Beside\")"
  }
]
~~~

This should give you the typical shortcuts for the pipe operator, the assignment operator etc. The ones I use commonly are the following:

- `Option` + `Shift` + `F`: format your R code
- `Option` + `-`: insert assignment operator
- `Ctr` + `Shift` + `M`: insert pipe operator

#### Help, I get an error when launching an R terminal!

In case you get an error like `The terminal process terminated with exit code: 1`, make sure that `"terminal.integrated.inheritEnv": true` in `settings.json` (this took me quite some time to figure out until I found [this issue](https://github.com/randy3k/radian/issues/170) on GitHub).

#### RMarkdown in VSCode

To run RMarkdown in VS Code, I use the [R Markdown All in One Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TianyiShi.rmarkdown#:~:text=R%20Markdown%20All%2Din%2DOne%20for%20VS%20Code&text=This%20extension%20provides%20a%20few,functions%20for%20Bookdown%20and%20Blogdown.). To make this work, though, you have to do some additional steps(see [here](https://github.com/REditorSupport/vscode-R/wiki/R-Markdown) for more detailed instructions): 

- install [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)
- in settings, add to file associations the key-value pair `"*.Rmd": "rmd"`
- install RMarkdown in R via `install.packages("rmarkdown")`
- install httr via `install.packages("httr")`
- install rticles extension to get RMarkdown templates via `install.packages("rticles")`

After doing that, you can easily write your markdown files via creating a new file with the file ending `.Rmd`, insert code chunks which you can run via a small button `Run Cell` that appears once you insert a Markdown cell and knit the whole Markdown document via the knit button in the upper right hand corner.

## Closing thoughts

Getting rid of RStudio and installing R for VS Code made me actually use R more often than before. No wonder: since I spend most of my time in VS Code anyways, it is easy to shortly open another file to run R instead of opening and using a whole new editor. I hope it helps you as well!
