Hey everyone! I am Kieran, currently a ML Research Intern at EMBL-EBI, master's student in Computational Biology at Cambridge and fascinated by bioinformatics and ML for biology. On this webpage you find my blog where I comment on new papers, developments and interesting experiences I have. 

Besides my research and studies, I love writing, reading, every sport that involves a ball and doing Blender visualisations such as the picture you see below showing K-Ras with an inhibitor or this video showing a [penicillin-binding protein](https://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/29).
