# Protein Geeks of all nations, unite - APFED 2022
Proteins are an amazing bunch - they control how you think, how you move and so much more while only consisting out of 20 different building blocks (yes, there are metal cofactors, glycosylation, phosphorylation and nowadays even RNA meddling into the protein business, but let's keep it simple for now). So no wonder I was always fascinated by them throughout my studies! Especially antibodies, peptides and how to design them became close to my heart during my time at Cambridge, so I was excited when I heard about the [APFED conference 2022](https://apfed22.uni-bayreuth.de/) in Bayreuth (APFED standing for Advances in Protein Folding, Evolution and Design). Meeting some exciting people and talking about some cool science sounded like quite a good time, especially after the pandemic, and spoiler: It was a good time! Here I want to share with you five cool research projects that I came across during the conference and why they excite me (I recently participated virtually in [RosettaCon 2022](https://www.rosettacommons.org/), more coming on that soon). Have fun!

## Lessons from outside the borders of biological protein space - Klara Hlouchovoa

As researchers we work with protein sequences to such an extent that we rarely take a step back and ask ourselves: how did these miracoulous things actually come about? Was it straightforward for evolution to get where we are currently or have there been major obstacles in the way? And why do we actually have these specific 20 amino acids instead of some others? 

These are big questions for sure, but in her talk Klara Hlouchovoa gave great insights into some of these questions with cleverly designed experiments that turned out to be quite thought-provoking!

Thanks a lot to the organizers of the APFED conference, both for creating such an amazing event and for giving me permissions to use their conference logo for this blogpost.
