# Protein Geeks of all nations, unite - APFED 2022
Proteins are an amazing bunch - they control how you think, how you move and so much more while only consisting out of 20 different building blocks (yes, there are metal cofactors, glycosylation, phosphorylation and nowadays even RNA meddling into the protein business, but let's keep it simple for now). So no wonder I was always fascinated by them throughout my studies! Especially antibodies and how to design them became close to my heart, so I was excited when I heard about the APFED conference 2022 in Bayreuth (APFED standing for Advances in Protein Folding, Evolution and Design). Meeting some exciting people and talking about some cool science sounded like quite a good time, especially after the pandemic, and spoiler: It was a good time! Here I want to share with you the three coolest research projects that I came across during the conference and why they excite me. Have fun!

## Why Zotero and Obsidian?
JS:

1) Factory Functions
- Methods are only attached to individual object

2) Constructor Functions
+ Methods now attached to prototype
- Attributes are in constructor function, but methods have to be defined separately ==> clunky

3) Classes (just syntactic sugar for constructor functions!)
+
- No true classes (see

## Setup

### Installing Zotero
With this massive pile of reading material on your mind, you might ask yourself: "Why does this guy want to start yet another blog?" Well, there are three main reasons for that:

### Configuring Zotero: Plugins, auto-export and more

1) When I struggle to understand something, writing it down into a cohesive piece with a logic in it orders my thoughts and helps me put things into perspective. I always liked this quote this quote from Frank Oppenheimer, paraphrased from Science Magazine:

### Installing Obsidian

Teaching definetely helped me getting a different point of view on things, no matter if that is basic chemistry or [data science with Python](https://github.com/kierandidi/Python_for_Biochemists).

### Configuring Obsidian: Templates, Citations and more

2) Even though the blog is mainly about organizing my thoughts and sharing my experiences, I hope that other people can get something out of that as well! I always enjoyed reading blogs and hearing people's opinions about stuff that I read as well, so I hope that at least some folks will have a similar experience reading my posts.

3) I missed writing so damn much.

## My typical workflow
So, that's it for my first post. I will focus future posts on content and my path in the CompBio field with topics such as ML applications in healthcare or protein design showing promise to become regular topics of discussion on here. 

If you got any comments to my posts or otherwise the desire to have a chat, just drop me a message via mail or Twitter! I was obsessive enough to write to random people whose work I found exciting and lucky enough to have many of them replying and chatting to me, so I intend to return this favor to everyone:) 

All the best and see you all soon!

P.S. This webpage is still in the build-up phase, so please forgive me if something does not work or show up as intended.
