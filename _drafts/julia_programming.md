# Julia - beautiful programming
As part of my master's program in Cambridge I got to work on deep learning with Julia. As a Python worshipper I was at first a bit sceptical about the hype around Julia (and still am a bit to be honest), but started to appreciate the upsides of using a language that was designed with scientific programming and machine learning as major applications in mind. In this post, I want to show you some concepts in Julia that might be familiar from Python and some that might not be in order to show you where Julia really shines. I won't talk much about Julia-specific syntax here; for this, see for example [this page](https://juliabyexample.helpmanual.io/) with great examples.

## Environments

As with other programming languages, it is always a good idea to separate your projects into different environments in order to avoid conflicting package versions and improve reproducibility.

While in Python you often use venv or conda, Julia offers its own tools for that:
